The goal of this project is to implement a singly linked list as a template class using pointers, providing a well-defined interface.
Memory management is handled through a private base class, with full support for copy and move semantics.
The implementation guarantees exception safety in all methods.
The development follows Test-Driven Development (TDD), with comprehensive tests validating functionality and robustness.
