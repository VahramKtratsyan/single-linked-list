Implement a single linked list as a template class with pointers using test-driven development and tracking the Single Responsibility Principle.                                                                                                ListBuffer is a class responsible for the memory management of the list. It handles the core functionalities such as dynamic memory allocation, deep copying, moving, and destruction of nodes.                                                 LinkedList is a derived class from ListBuffer and provides the public interface for list operations.
